                <p>This is one of my more favourite projects. This memory game was made using JavaScript logic, HTML for
                    the base structure and CSS for the added decorations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This project was a fun challenge as it provided the most challenges quite early on, that were both
                    frustrating to understand but also very fun to solve. For instace, I had an issue where the images
                    of the fruits were too large, wouldn't fit inside the card container or would get stuck behind the
                    starry backdrop.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I was able to fix this by moving the images to a JSON file and fetching them from
                    there. This helped me learn more about JSON in my own time as well, to understand it further.

                    Have a play around and see if you like it.

                    This to-do list has multiple functions, ranging from storing, loading and deleting data, to crossing
                    out completed tasks, mainly for the sake of keeping track of what has and has not been completed.

                    <br>

                    I took the idea from this To Do List, and added aspects to the Recommended Shows table on the Shows
                    page. It was a good learning experience.
